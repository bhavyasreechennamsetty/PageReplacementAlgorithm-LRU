# PageReplacementAlgorithm-LRU
This project simulates the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm, an essential concept in operating systems. LRU replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period of time when memory is full and a new page needs to be loaded.

The simulation is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides an interactive way to visualize how LRU works, helping users understand page faults, hits, and the flow of memory management.

🚀 Features
Interactive web-based simulation of LRU page replacement

Visual representation of memory frames and page changes

Tracks and displays page hits and page faults

User input for number of frames and page reference strings

Lightweight, responsive, and user-friendly interface

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML – Structure of the web page

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Logic for LRU simulation and user interaction
